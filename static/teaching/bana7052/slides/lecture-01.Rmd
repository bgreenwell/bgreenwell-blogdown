# Pearson correlation

.large[

* The (Pearson) correlation coefficient (also called the *Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient*) between two random variables $X$ and $Y$ is given by 

$$Cor\left(X, Y\right) = \rho = \frac{Cov\left(X,Y\right)}{\sigma_X\sigma_Y}$$

* Given a sample $\left\{\left(x_i, y_i\right)\right\}_{i=1}^n$, we estimate $\rho$ with $r = S_{xy} / \sqrt{S_{xx}S_{yy}}$

  - Where, for example, $S_{xy} = \sum_{i=1}^n\left(x_i - \bar{x}\right)\left(y_i - \bar{y}\right)$

]


---

# Pearson correlation

.medium[

* It is common to test the hypothesis $H_0: \rho = 0$ vs. $H_1: \rho \ne 0$

    - Rejecting $H_0$ is only evidence that $\rho$ is **not exactly zero**

    - A *p*-value **does not measure the magnitude of the (linear) association**

    - Sample size affects the p-value! `r emo::ji("scream")`

* There is a formal relationship between Pearson's correlation and the *simple linear regression* (SLR) model

    - Simple linear relationships can be described by a *slope* and *intercept*

]


---

# Interpretting correlation(s) `r emo::ji("warning")`

.large[

* Correlation between $X$ and $Y$ does not imply causation

    - It does not imply the direction of any possible **causal relationship** between $X$ and $Y$
    
    - There might be a third (*lurking*) variable that is the cause of changes in both variables (i.e., the association between $X$ and $Y$ might be indirect)
    
* The Pearson correlation only measures the **linear association **between $X$ and $Y$

    - Does there appear to be an association between these two variables?

* Use the `cor()` and `cor.test()` functions to assess the Pearson correlation between these two variables

    - **Hint:** Use `?cor` and `?cor.test` to see how to use these functions and for explanations of their respective output

# Properites of SLR

.large[

    - Implies the model is **linear in the regression coefficients $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$**
    
* The error term is a random variable; hence, $Y_i$ is also a random variable (**Why?** `r emo::ji("thinking")`)

    - What is $E\left(Y_i|X_i\right)$ and $Var\left(Y_i|X_i\right)$?

* $\beta_1$ is the slope of the regression line

# How do we estimate $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$?

* Ideally, we want estimates of $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ that give us the "best fitting" line

    - But what is meant by "best fitting"?

--

* The most common approach is to use the method of *least squares* (LS) estimation

* The LS estimates of $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ minimize the residual sum of squares (RSS):

$$RSS\left(\beta_0, \beta_1\right) = \sum_{i=1}^n\left[Y_i = \left(\beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i\right)\right]^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n\left(Y_i - \beta_0 - \beta_1 X_i\right)^2$$

Since $Y_i \stackrel{indep.}{\sim} N\left(\beta_0 + \beta_1X_i, \sigma^2\right)$, the *likelihood function* for the data (as a function of $\beta_0$, $\beta_1$, and $\sigma^2$) is given by 

$$L\left(\beta_0, \beta_1, \sigma^2\right) = \prod_{i=1}^nf\left(Y_i; \beta_0 + \beta_1X_i, \sigma^2\right),$$ where $$f\left(Y_i; \beta_0 + \beta_1X_i, \sigma^2\right) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp\left(-\frac{Y_i - \beta_0 - \beta_1 X_i}{2\sigma^2}\right)$$ is the *probability density function* (PDF) of a normal distribution with mean $\beta_0 + \beta_1X_i$ and variance $\sigma^2$.

# Maximum likelihood estimation

* Maximizing the likelihood is the same as maximizing the *log-likelihood* $l = \log\left(L\right)$ (**Why?** `r emo::ji("thinking")`)

* The full log-likelihood is given by 

$$l = -\frac{n}{2}\log\left(2\pi\right) - \frac{n}{2}\log\left(\sigma^2\right) - \frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\sum_{i=1}^n\left(Y_i - \beta_0 - \beta_1X_i\right)^2$$

* Maximum likelihood (ML) estimates of $\beta_0$, $\beta_1$, and $\sigma^2$ can be found by equating the (partial) derivatives of $l$ to zero:

    - $\frac{\partial l}{\partial \beta_0} = \frac{1}{\sigma^2}\sum_{i=1}^n\left(Y_i - \beta_0 - \beta_1X_i\right)$
    
    - $\frac{\partial l}{\partial \beta_1} = \frac{1}{\sigma^2}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i\left(Y_i - \beta_0 - \beta_1X_i\right)$
    
    - $\frac{\partial l}{\partial \sigma^2} = -\frac{n}{2\sigma^2} + \frac{1}{\sigma^4}\sum_{i=1}^n\left(Y_i - \beta_0 - \beta_1X_i\right)^2$

* As it turns out, the ML estimates of $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ (under our current assumptions) are the same as the corresponding LS estimates

* ML estimation, however, provides us with an estimate of the error variance $\sigma^2$ 
$$\widehat{\sigma}_{MLE}^2 = \frac{1}{n}\sum{i=1}^n e_i^2$$

* However, since $\widehat{\sigma}_{MLE}^2$ is a biased estimate for the error variance, we use an adjusted estimate

$$\widehat{\sigma}^2 = \frac{1}{n-2}\sum{i=1}^n e_i^2 = MSE$$

Use the `fitted()`, `residuals()`, and `sigma()` functions to obtain the fitted values, residuals, and RMSE, respectively, for the crystal weight example. Confirm the formula for the residuals.
